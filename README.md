BREATHE

This is my first project, and the idea is to create a website that teaches users how to use a simple breathing technique
that many find beneficial in their everyday lives. The creator of this method is Wim Hof. The techniques he teaches improves your 
energy levels, reduce stress, have balancing effects on the nervous system and strengthen the immune system.

The website consists of three pages; one overview landing page with a short introduction and classes listed underneath, another page
to explain a basic technique, and a third contact page.

I have recently been using Adobe Illustrator for different projects, so I decided to use my own illustrations for this website.


UX
Using the five planes of UX I will in the following detail the UX thought process

Strategy
I think the creation of this site can be justified in that it's getting more and more popular in modern society to incooporate
wellness/yoga/breathing exercises into everyday life. This particular exercise is easy, and the effects can be profound, which I believe
creates enough value for users.

The target audience is the average person. I would say usually a person who works a non-physical job or a person who has a certain 
mental load put on them in their everyday lives, but it's really meant for most people. It does not require the person to be fit, but 
perhaps it does require them to not have any serious problems with their lungs.

Tech considerations are simple as we can explain the technique using nothing but HTML and CSS in the form of text and pictures. It 
would perhaps augment the user experience to have animations and Javascript for more interactivity, but as the exercise are simple it is
not a necessity.

The research is drawn from the now world famous Wim Hof, also known as the Ice Man, who conducts seminars on cold resistance and breathing 
techniques. He often coaches celebrities and enjoys great attention for the results he produces. To this I am also using my own experience 
using this technique. I was exposed to it for the first time while viewing a podcast, and I have since then used this one particular exercise 
myself with great results.

Scope
The scope is mild, and will not involve extended planning/sprints. The information of the technique is already out there. It will involve
 myself drawing illustrations and writing the information in my own words to not present directly copied information.



In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
